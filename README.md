# Flask Foundation
This template contains the basics needed to get your Flask project up and running in no time. You can see a full list of the Python libraries needed via the requirements file, with the most important including:

* __[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)__ - the core web development framework used here
* __[Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)__ - a library that deftly handle all sorts of user logins
* __[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) + [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/) + [sqlalchemy-migrate](https://code.google.com/p/sqlalchemy-migrate/)__ - for abstraction and database management</li>
* __[Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)__ - for input forms</li>
* __[Flask-WhooshAlchemy](https://github.com/gyllstromk/Flask-WhooshAlchemy)__ - for searches</li>

Also included are the following structural elements to get your project started:

* A simple SQLite database with migration scripts.
* A script (run.py) to easily stop/start the Flask's web server.
* A basic template structure and MVC layout.
* A testing file using Python's unittest module.

### To Get Started...

1. Install the required Python extensions and frameworks
2. Setup your database with the provided migration scripts
3. Test out the server
4. Now get started.

That's it - a simple structure to get you started.
